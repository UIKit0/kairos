For the moment ubuntu natty(11.04) doesn't provide a dovecot 2.x package 
but it could be generated from debian testing using the following commands :

add debian source repository in /etc/apt/sources.list
deb-src http://xi.rename-it.nl/debian/ testing-auto/dovecot-2.0 main

# update apt
sudo apt-get update

apt-get source dovecot

cd dovecot-2.0.x
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b
cd ..
ls *.deb
dpkg -i *.deb

I have also included some configuration files for dovecot 2.x but it's not
complete and needs more work.
